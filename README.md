# Smoov

Makes your [Zenhub](http://zenhub.com/) boards **smoov** as.

This hacked together extension extends the design of [Zenhubs](http://zenhub.com/) kanban boards (hosted on [Github](https://github.com/)). It simply strips them down removing a ton of clutter making it ideal if you want to cast this to another monitor or screen. 

Why? Well I can't think with all the mess on the board when I'm just wanting to see what's on and if I'm making progress.


## Future

Well this kinda serves my purpose but it would be nice to get a designer across this and make it nicer still. I'd also like to work on adding options so people can style it however they want but hey that might be over thinking it. If you're reading this and interested feel free to drop me a message as an issue or submit a PR.

## Usage

Currently this ain't on Google, so you'd have to pull this repo and install it as a developer extension. Check out Google's [getting started guide](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted).
